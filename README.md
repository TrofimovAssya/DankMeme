# DankMeme
Build a character-level LSTM to generate popular Memes.

#First step: Get dataset!
Scrapped memes from memegenerator.net (see code) (about 14000 sentences...)
I used only 
"in soviet russia", "one does not simply" and "most interesting man in the world" memes.

#Step two: Build LSTM and generate (dank) memes.
